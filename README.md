##ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Hi, my name is Breno Valinhas, and I am a mechanical engineer proficient in data analysis techniques and I have already developed several solutions applied to condition-based maintenance using Microsoft Power BI. I can leverage data from multiple data sources and perform machine learning predictions using tools like Python and Azure ML. As a mechanical engineer, I have been looking at rotating equipment in the oil and gas industry to reduce maintenance costs and minimize unplanned downtime.
